## 📊 Business Logic & Algorithms

### **Area Calculation Logic**
```javascript
// Example: Reception area calculation based on total area
const calculateReceptionArea = (totalArea) => {
  if (totalArea >= 1000 && totalArea < 3500) {
    return Math.round(totalArea * 0.08);
  } else if (totalArea >= 3500 && totalArea < 4500) {
    return Math.round(totalArea * 0.06);
  }
  // ... additional ranges
};
```

### **Space Allocation Rules**
- **Reception**: 5-8% of total area (varies by size)
- **Lounge**: 6-11% of total area (varies by size)
- **Meeting Rooms**: Based on total area thresholds
- **Support Spaces**: Fixed allocations based on requirements

### **Validation Rules**
- Minimum area: 1,000 sq ft
- Maximum area: 25,000 sq ft
- Input sanitization and type checking
- Real-time feedback for invalid inputs

## 🎤 Common Interview Questions & Answers

### **Technical Questions**

**Q: Why did you choose React for the frontend?**
A: React was chosen for its component-based architecture, which perfectly fits the modular nature of space calculations. The virtual DOM ensures efficient updates for real-time calculations, and the ecosystem provides excellent charting libraries like ApexCharts for visualization.

**Q: How did you handle state management in a complex form application?**
A: I used React's built-in useState for local component state and props drilling for parent-child communication. For future scalability, I'd consider implementing Context API or Redux for global state management.

**Q: Explain your approach to making the application responsive.**
A: I implemented a mobile-first approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox. The treemap visualization adapts to screen size using responsive chart configurations. All touch interactions are optimized for mobile devices.

**Q: How did you ensure data accuracy in calculations?**
A: I implemented comprehensive validation at multiple levels: frontend input validation, business logic validation, and backend constraints. All calculations are unit tested, and edge cases are handled explicitly.

**Q: What security measures did you implement?**
A: Authentication via Supabase with JWT tokens, input sanitization, XSS protection through React, HTTPS encryption, and role-based access control. All sensitive operations require authentication.

### **System Design Questions**

**Q: How would you scale this application for 10,000+ concurrent users?**
A: I'd implement horizontal scaling with load balancers, introduce caching layers (Redis), optimize database queries with proper indexing, use CDN for static assets, and consider microservices architecture for calculation engine.

**Q: How would you handle real-time collaboration between multiple users?**
A: I'd implement WebSocket connections via Supabase real-time features, operational transformation for conflict resolution, and optimistic updates with conflict detection and resolution strategies.

**Q: Describe your database design decisions.**
A: I used PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and complex queries. The schema includes proper foreign key relationships, indexes on frequently queried fields, and JSONB for flexible configuration storage.

### **Problem-Solving Questions**

**Q: How did you approach the complex business logic for area calculations?**
A: I analyzed the requirements to identify patterns and ranges, created modular functions for each calculation type, implemented comprehensive testing, and made the logic configurable for future changes.

**Q: What was your biggest technical challenge and how did you solve it?**
A: The biggest challenge was creating a responsive, interactive treemap that updates in real-time. I solved it by optimizing the chart rendering pipeline, implementing efficient state updates, and adding proper loading states.

**Q: How do you ensure code quality and maintainability?**
A: I follow React best practices, implement comprehensive testing, use ESLint for code consistency, write clear documentation, and structure components in a logical hierarchy with single responsibility principle.
